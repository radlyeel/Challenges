# Challenges 
Coding Challenges on LinkedIn.  I saw th is last night but now I can't find it.
I'll add references later.

## wc

The first challenge is to write my own version of the classic Unix utility
'wc'.The reference will be wc's man page.  I'll use the getopt function to
process the command line options. In the spirit of "classic Unix utility"
I'll use C (with Vim, make, and gcc).

option --lbxo is not implemented, for lack of documentation


### References
man wc
man 3 getopt
